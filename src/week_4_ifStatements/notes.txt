Topics: Recap
		Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
		If Statements:
				single if
Warmup task:
	1. Create a class called IdentifyNumber, and write a program
	that can identify if the given number is positive, or negative or zero.
			Ex:
				number = 200
			output:
		        200 is positive number: true
		        200 is negative number: false
		        200 is zero: false


    2. Create a class called EvenlyDivisible,and write a program that can check
    if a number is evenly divisible by 2, 3, 5
    		Ex:
				number = 65;
			output:
				65 is divisible by 2: false
				65 is divisible by 3: false
				65 is divisible by 5: true

Variables: Container for Data, makes the data reusable
		Declare:
			DataType VariableName = Data;

		DataTypes:
			int: for integer numbers
			double: for decimal numbers
			char: for single characters, '', every single character has a number
			boolean: true/false

			String: String of text, ""

Concatenation: Concating a value (any type) to String, +

Operators:
	-, +, *, /, %
	--, ++
	=, +=, -=
	>, >=, <, <=, ==, !=

	&&, ||, !


&&: both
	in logical and operator, both expressions need to be true in order to return true

||: either
	in logical or operator only one expression needs to be true in order to return true

if statements:
	Single if: can be used creating cindition for 1 possible output

Task
	1. write a program that can display the name of the month
			number = 1 ~ 12

	2. write a program that can display the name of the day
			number = 1 ~ 7

	3. Write a program that can print the number of days in a month
			Ex:
				number = 1 ~ 12;

			output:
				31 Days

			Hints:
				Months that has 31 days: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12
				Months that has 30 days: 4, 6, 9, 11
				Month that has 28 days: 2

Topics: If & Else Statement
		Multi-Branch If

Warmup tasks:
	1. Create a class called MinNumber, Write a program that
	can print the minimum number between two numbers, if both are equal then print Equal
			Ex:
				n1= 100, n2 = 200;

			output:
				100 is the minimum number

			n1 & n2

			possibility #1: n1 is Min
			possibility #2: n2 is Min
			possibility #3: equal

	2. Create a class called MedianNumber. write a program that
	can find the median number between three DIFFERENT given integers
			Ex:
				a = 10, b= 15, c = 20;

			Output:
				15 is the median number

			Possibility #1: a could be median number
			Possibility #2: b could be median number
			Possibility #3: c could be median number

Single if: for one condition

if & else: when there are only two option/possibilities ( not more not less than 2 condition)

		if(Condition){
			StatementA
		}else{ // otherwise
			StatementB
		}

		StatementA: if condition MUST be true
		StatementB: if condition MUST be false


		Yes or No
		Leap year
		Female or Male
		Pass or Fail
		Married or not Married
		employed or not employed
		Odd or Even
		Eligible or not eligible

Multi-branch if: when there are three or more option/possibilities

		if(Condition1){
			StatementA
		}else if(Condition2){
			StatementB
		}else{
			StatementC
		}

		ONLY one block gets executed

		StatementA: Condition1 MUST be true
		StatementB: Condition1 MUST be false, Condition2 MUST be true
		StatementC: Condition1 & Condition2 MUST be false

task:
		1. Maximum number between two different numbers
		2. Minimum number between two different numbers
		3. Write a program that can check if the person is eligible to buy alcohol
		4. Write a program that can check if the person is eligible to vote

Task:
	1. garde report ==> A, B, C, D, F
	2. name of the month
